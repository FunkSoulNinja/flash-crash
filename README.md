# Flash Crash

A flash card study app I made for practice. I apologize in advanced if the code is ugly to look at. I'm currently in the process of refactoring the code.

Currently at the iOS app store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flash-crash/id1269923007?mt=8

Works great on Android, but is not available in Google Play store.
